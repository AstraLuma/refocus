refocus program.

Read a raw data file as generated by lfpsplitter when run on the .lfp file from your lytro camera.  So first parameter is image.raw.  Second parameter is the focus that you want on the image.  Ren Ng's dissertation has a focusing formula of
u(1 - 1/a), v(1 - 1/a) where a is the alpha value.  That alpha value is the third parameter to refocus.  So "refocus image.raw 1.0" would show you the image focused on the camera's true focus plane.  To move the focus plane further from the camera, a has to decrease towards 0.0.  Likewise to focus towards the camera, you start at -1.0, and the closer you get to -0.0 the closer your focus plane is to the camera.


version 1.1 - very minor bug fix.
